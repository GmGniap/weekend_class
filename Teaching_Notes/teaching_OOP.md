# OOP in Python
## Jan 20, 2024
- It's almost 3 weeks that kids started learning OOP. Today, I need to discuss with them about static method & class method in OOP.
- What does `cls` works in Class Methods?
    - `cls` is a class factory (aka constructor function)
    - Inheritance + Class method - should read and think about this [article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24799403/what-does-cls-function-do-inside-a-class-method)
    - Basically , even if classmethod is declared in Parent class but it's used in Child class , `cls` will represent Child class.
- `staticmethod` - function that doesn't related with other class instances.
