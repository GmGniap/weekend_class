# Reading Week 1 - March 26,2023
- We decided to read "Everything You Need to Ace Computer Science & Coding in One Big Fat Notebook" books with kids starting from this week.
- I haven't decided yet how many pages (or) chapters should be read in one session.
- But the main purpose is to encourage their reading habits, making discussions between the group, practice thinking while reading.
- So, it isn't rush to finish the book. Instead of that, if I can plant a seed of reading habit in their minds, they can continue by themselves in the future.
